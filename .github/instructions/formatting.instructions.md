In lines ending in `_ga`, italicize phrases that are being discussed for their formatting or grammatical function. This should also apply to letters, or words. E.g. _d_, _t_, nó _s_. 
Single consonants are almost always italicized.
For translations that contain `-sample-`, use bold instead of italics.
These bold translations are translated more literally to reflect the structure of the Irish sentence.
If whole sentences are used as examples, they are usually italicized.
