        A lot of work was assisted by machine translation.
        While these are heavily QC'd, I'm sure there will be mistakes I

        The project is tracked at <a class="text-blue-400"
          href="https://github.com/calculuswhiz/caighdean-i18n">GitHub</a>.
        You can find a roadmap of the project there. We are still a bit away from 1st draft status.
